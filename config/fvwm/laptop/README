I treat "maximized" windows as if I'm putting them into "tiling" mode.

"Shift" is the alternate version of an existing keybind.
"Control" means that it deals with page operations.
Numbers mean desk operations.

I try to avoid un-ergonomic binds, and prefer mneumonic binds.

I try to keep binds similar to Windows so there is less overhead when switching.

Ideally, every action must be able to be accomplished through both a mouse and a keybind.

For each application, I try to use a mix of CUA and Vim binds.


Desks are meant to be completely disjoint. No operations should be cross-desk.

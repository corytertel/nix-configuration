#+title:Xmomacs

This rice/setup is designed to be a merge between xmonad and exwm.

Essentially it is xmonad but you use it like emacs. The window management is xmonad but the user interaction with the wm is like emacs.
This makes for a uniform interaction between the system and the emacs program.

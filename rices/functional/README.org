#+title:Xmomacs

This rice/setup is designed to be a merge between xmonad and exwm.

Essentially it is xmonad but you use it like emacs.
The window management is xmonad but the user interaction with the wm is like emacs.
This makes for a uniform interaction between the system and the emacs program.

Xmonad but you use it like exwm.
The frontend user experience and user interation is the exact
same as you would use exwm, except with xmonad features and an xmonad backend.


Xmonad replaces the window manager within emacs.
Instead of different frames within emacs, the frames are created as X windows
and xmonad manages them.

There is one level of abstraction. The same keybinds manage X windows and emacs

;;; Commentary:

;; Generates a notification for any command that takes longer than a given
;; ammount of seconds to return to the shell.
;; e.g. if LONG_RUNNING_COMMAND_TIMEOUT=10, then 'sleep 11' will always
;; generate a notification.

;; Relies on eshell-pre-command-hook and eshell-before-prompt-hook.

;; Hook eshell-undistract-me-pre-command into eshell-pre-command-hook
;; and eshell-undistract-me-before-prompt into ehsell-before-prompt-hook.

;; Requires libnotify to be installed.  By default uses pulseaudio's
;; `paplay'.  Any command can be used to play audio by changing
;; `eshell-undistract-me-sound-command'.

;;; Customization
